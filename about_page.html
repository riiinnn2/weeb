        <p class="about"><strong style="color: bisque">Pellicula</strong> - is an unique and convenient online cinema platform that offers a wide variety of exciting content.
            In the late '90s, we started as purely DVD movie rental service. With time by growing and analyzing changes in customers
            interests and needs, our company decided to introduce a streaming service. It allowed users to watch television shows or movies
            online by using their personal computers. Later found out that the decision was the right one, and it brought our website to huge success.
            Today, we provide many more materials, such as TV  shows, movies, and cartoons. We created a website where you and your family can freely
            watch any videos in excellent quality without registration. All you have to do is press the button «play» and enjoy your favourite movie
            or show anywhere and anytime.</p>
